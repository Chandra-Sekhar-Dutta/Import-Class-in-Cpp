# Import Class in CPP

This is a simple C++ project that demonstrates the use of classes and object-oriented programming concepts.


## Files

### `main.cpp`
This file contains the `main` function, which serves as the entry point of the program. It creates an object of the `MyClass` class and calls its methods.

### `MyClass.h`
This is the header file for the `MyClass` class. It declares the class and its public methods.

### `MyClass.cpp`
This file contains the implementation of the `MyClass` class methods, including the constructor and the `showMessage` function.

### `myprogram.exe`
This is the compiled executable file generated after building the project.

## How to Build and Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler, such as `g++`:
   ```sh
   g++ main.cpp MyClass.cpp -o myprogram.exe

3. Run the compiled executable:
   ```sh
   ./myprogram.exe
